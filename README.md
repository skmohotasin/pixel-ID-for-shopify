#Customer data-sharing events

After you add a Facebook pixel in Shopify, the pixel tracks certain events on your online store, such as when a customer views a certain page. You can use the data from these events to learn more about how customers interact with your store. Learn more about using Facebook pixel events to create campaigns and track conversions at the Facebook Help Center.

Events that track an order value use an order's subtotal, which doesn't include taxes or shipping costs.

After you integrate a Facebook pixel with your online store, the pixel automatically tracks the following events.


Event name	Event description
ViewContent	When a visitor views a page, such as a product page
Search	When a visitor makes a search
AddToCart	When a visitor adds a product to the shopping cart
InitiateCheckout	When a visitor clicks the checkout button
AddPaymentInfo	When a visitor enters payment information in the checkout
Purchase	When a visitor completes a purchase and views the thank you page in the checkout
